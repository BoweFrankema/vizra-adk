}
```

### Results

### Usage Examples

```php
// Basic customer support
$response = EcommerceSupportAgent::ask("My order hasn't arrived yet")->forUser($user);

// With order context
$response = EcommerceSupportAgent::ask("I want to return this item")
    ->forUser($user)
    ->withContext(['order_id' => 'ORD-12345']);

// In a Laravel controller
class SupportController extends Controller
{
    public function chat(Request $request)
    {
        $response = EcommerceSupportAgent::ask($request->input('message'))
            ->forUser(auth()->user())
            ->withSession($request->session()->getId());
            
        return response()->json(['response' => $response]);
    }
}
```

**Customer Interaction:**
```
Customer: Hi, I'm John Smith and my order ORD-12345 hasn't arrived yet. It was supposed to be here yesterday!

Agent: Hi John! I completely understand your frustration about the delayed delivery - that's definitely not the experience we want for you. Let me look up your order right away to see exactly what's happening.

[Uses OrderLookupTool]

I can see your order ORD-12345 for the Dell XPS 13 laptop. The good news is that your package is actually out for delivery today! It looks like there was a one-day delay due to weather in the shipping hub, but the tracking shows it's on the delivery truck now and should arrive by 6 PM today.

I've also noted in your account that you prefer morning deliveries, so I'll make sure future orders are scheduled accordingly. 

Is there anything else I can help you with today? I want to make sure we get this resolved completely for you!

Customer: That's great, thank you! Actually, I was thinking about buying a wireless mouse too. Do you have any recommendations?

Agent: Absolutely! Let me search our current mouse selection and find something that would pair perfectly with your new Dell XPS 13.

[Uses ProductSearchTool with laptop compatibility filter]

Based on your laptop choice, I'd recommend the Logitech MX Master 3S - it's specifically designed for professionals and pairs beautifully with Dell laptops. It has amazing precision, long battery life, and works seamlessly across multiple devices.

Would you like me to add it to a new order, or would you prefer to browse a few more options first?

### Progressive Enhancement

```php
// Start simple, add complexity gradually
class CustomerServiceEvolution
{
    // Version 1: Basic FAQ bot
    public function basicAgent(): string
    {
        return Agent::run('basic_faq', $input);
    }
    
    // Version 2: Add order lookup
    public function withOrderLookup(): string
    {
        // Add OrderLookupTool to existing agent
        return Agent::run('enhanced_support', $input);
    }
    
    // Version 3: Add memory and personalization
    public function withMemory(): string
    {
        // Add VectorMemoryTool for customer history
        return Agent::run('personalized_support', $input);
    }
    
    // Version 4: Add AI evaluation for quality
    public function withQualityMonitoring(): string
    {
        $response = Agent::run('full_support', $input);
        
        // Evaluate response quality
        $evaluation = EvaluationRunner::run('support_quality', $input, $response);
        
        return $response;
    }
}
```

## üìà Business Impact Examples

### Customer Support ROI

**Before Laravel AI ADK:**
- 24/7 coverage required 3 support staff = $180,000/year
- Average response time: 4 hours
- Resolution rate: 65%
- Customer satisfaction: 3.2/5

**After Laravel AI ADK:**
- 1 support staff + AI agent = $60,000/year + $1,200/year (API costs)
- Average response time: 30 seconds
- Resolution rate: 85% (AI handles 70% of inquiries)
- Customer satisfaction: 4.6/5

**ROI: $118,800 savings per year**

### Content Creation Efficiency

**Before:**
- Content writer: $75,000/year
- Output: 8 blog posts/month, 20 social posts/week
- Research time: 40% of total time

**After:**
- Content writer + AI agent: $75,000 + $600/year
- Output: 20 blog posts/month, 50 social posts/week
- Research time: 10% of total time

**Result: 150% increase in content output, 75% faster research**

## üéâ Getting Started with Examples

1. **Choose your use case** from the examples above
2. **Start with the basic agent** structure
3. **Add one tool at a time** to build complexity gradually
4. **Test with real data** using the evaluation framework
5. **Iterate based on performance** metrics and user feedback
